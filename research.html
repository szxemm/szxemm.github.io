          <h3>Research interests</h3><hr>
          <p>My research interests include: formal demography, especially fertility and migration;
            Immigrant incorporation in the global South; Family demography, especially marital union
            and dissolution and the relationships with health outcomes (NCDs to be specific) and
            religious activities; Remittances; and Research methods.</p>
          <p> My current research examines labor market integration of African-born immigrants in South Africa
            and remitting behavior of African immigrants.
            Although numerous studies have examined the same in the developed nations of the global North, similar
            research in the global South remain scant. One of the key labor market distinctions between developed and developing
            economies is the relatively large informal sectors, which appear to impede immigrants' incorporation.</p>

          <summary><b>Estimating the effect of HIV/AIDS on fertility among Malawian women using demographic and health survey data.</b></summary>

          <p style="size:7">
            Several studies have shown that HIV is an important distal factor that affects a woman's fertility.
            This study investigates the effect of HIV on fertility among Malawian women using data from the 2004
            and 2010 demographic and health surveys. Specifically, the study assesses fertility differentials between
            HIV-positive and HIV-negative women and the changes in the relationship between HIV and fertility during
            the study period. Age-specific fertility rates and logistic regressions are used to investigate these objectives.
            The results show lower age-specific fertility rates (except for the 15–19-year-old age group) and probabilities of
            giving birth for HIV-positive relative to HIV-negative women before and after controlling for confounding factors respectively.
            The odds of giving birth for an HIV-positive woman were 34% lower in the period 12 months before the 2004 survey compared to
            an HIV-negative woman and 25% lower before the 2010 survey (p < 0.01). We think that the scaling up of antiretroviral treatment
            has contributed to the increase in the likelihood of giving birth among HIV-positive women between 2004 and 2010, more plausibly
            entailing a possible reduction in HIV sub-fecundity.</br>

          <p><h5 style="color:blue">Souza, E. and C. Flippen, 2020.<i>Working paper</i></h5></p>
          <p style="size:7">
          This study explores the process of labor market incorporation among migrant men in South
          Africa, which has become a magnet for regional immigration in recent decades. Using 2011
          Census data, we compare the employment rates, class of worker, occupation, and income of
          African immigrants, by region of origin, to South African-born internal migrants, and
          examine how these outcomes are associated with various forms of human capital. Results
          show that, overall, immigrant men enjoy higher employment levels compared to internal
          migrants. However, this immigrant employment advantage does not extend into other labor
          market outcomes. Immigrant men are over-represented in the informal sector, which
          contributes to generally lower-income relative to South Africans. The returns to education are
          also markedly lower for immigrants than for their internal migrant counterparts. Results also
          highlight variations across regional- and national-origin groups, with better-resourced groups
          exhibiting more favorable outcomes than longer-established but lower-skilled co-ethnic
          communities.</br>

        <summary><b>Remarriage timing and its associated factors among women in rural Malawi</b></summary>
        <p><h5 style="color:blue">Souza, E., 2020.<i> Working paper</i> </h5></p>
        <p style="size:7">
          This study examines the timing of and factors associated with remarriages in rural Malawi and
          assess the economic need hypothesis of union formation. Data come from the Malawi Longitudinal
          Study of Families and Health conducted between 1998 and 2010. Results show that irrespective of
          the marriage order, remarriages after divorce are quick and near-universal. Cox proportional hazard
          models also show that results support the economic need hypothesis, but mainly through frequent access
          to cash. Women, who were not involved in income-generating activities after separation, were more
          likely to remarry than their counterparts who participated in some economic activities. Other factors
          such as region, religion, the period of separation, and co-residence with parents after separation also
          explain the hazard of remarriage. We argue that while sub-Saharan African women experience financial
          deterioration after separation, economic reasons do not fully explain their remarriages.</br>

        <summary><b>Patterns and motivations of remitting to sub-Saharan Africa households: Evidence from four countries</b></summary>
        <p><h5 style="color:blue">Souza, E., 2020.<i> Working paper</i></h5></p>
        <p style="size:7">
          Between 2010 and 2018, formal remittances to sub-Saharan Africa increased by 40%. This paper examines the patterns
          and motivations of remitting behavior reported by receiving householders surveyed in Burkina Faso, Senegal, Kenya,
          and Uganda. We explore how migrant and origin household characteristics shape remitting behavior besides
          making cross-country comparisons. Results show that remitters are more likely to be close family members,
          with paid employment, married, and who migrated beyond continental borders. In addition, households with the
          most financial need are more likely to receive remittances and, on average, receive large remittances
          than moderately need households. Furthermore, findings highlight the importance of combining migrant
          and sending-household characteristics in assessing remitting behavior. Migrant rather than origin
          household characteristics are more salient determinants of remitting behavior among sub-Saharan Africa
          emigrants. As such, we view altruism as the primary motive behind remittances, although results also
          point to insurance as a motivation. However, we argue that the altruistic behavior is driven by the
          <i>obligation</i> to remit rather than mere concern for the non-migrating household. National origin results
          underscore the importance of access to international labor markets and origin country’s level of development
          in determining the pattern and use of remittances.</br>

        <summary><b>Human capital, family structure, and labour market incorporation of immigrant women in South Africa</b></summary>
        <p><h5 style="color:blue">Souza, E., 2020.<i> Working paper</i></h5></p>
        <p style="size:7">
          This article examines the labour market incorporation of African-born immigrant women in South Africa using data from the 2011 Census.
          It investigates women’s labour force participation, employment prospects, access to formal employment,
          and assesses how human capital and household factors explain labour market decisions. Results underscore
          significant challenges to immigrant incorporation in South Africa. Not only are immigrants less likely
          to participate in the labour force, but for those who participate, employment levels are also lower
          than South African women. Although immigrants have an employment edge over South Africans once individual
          and household factors are held constant, immigrants are overrepresented in informal jobs. Returns to
          human capital are also lower among foreign- than South African-born women. Together, these results
          suggest a segmented pattern of incorporation for immigrant women in South Africa. National origin results
          emphasize the importance of egalitarianism and co-ethnic community characteristics in structuring women’s labour force participation.</br>
